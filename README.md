# kPack

kPack is an evolutionary-based algorithm implementation designed for solving the two-dimensional irregular shape packing problem.

## Description


kPack has implemented the necessary functionalities to define the geometrical parameters of the container(s) and the object(s) that are going to be
added to the container(s). Besides that, kPack has an internal implementation of EA algorithm designed specifically to solve this problem.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* OS: Windows/Linux
* Python3.8 or later

### Installing


* Currently, the only support is for the \*nix-based systems
* Currently, the only support is for the execuatble files not library files


To install simply
```
git clone https://github.com/keagleV/kPack.git
```

```
cd ./kPack
```

```
cd ./Release 
```
```
pip3 install kPack-1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```




### Executing program

To execute the program, first create an object file that represents the geometrical parameters of the container and the items that are going to
be placed in the container.


Then use the kpack program to start the computation:
```
kpack -f PATH_TO_OBJECT_FILE
```
